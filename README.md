## 🌟 Vision
MindMatrix is an **interactive console-based DSA-driven platform** designed to **challenge, entertain, and enhance logical thinking**.  
It combines **data structures, algorithm visualization, and brain games** in a single system.  

**Goal:** Create a platform for **learning through play**, where users can experience the **power of algorithms and data structures** in action while enjoying gamified challenges.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Build a **fun and interactive console UI**  
- Integrate **DSA concepts** like arrays, stacks, queues, linked lists, recursion, sorting, and searching  
- Develop **pattern and brain games** that stimulate logical thinking and problem-solving  
- Provide a **modular system** to add more games or puzzles easily in the future
